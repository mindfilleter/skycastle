Starting a new adventure in the Sky Castle...

--- The Calling of the Sky Castle ---
  The Sky Castle, a magnificent structure woven from memories and dreams, once
  sparkled like a jewel suspended amongst the clouds. You remember your
  father, a visionary architect, his eyes filled with the joy of creation,
  always humming and planning, building your shared 'castle in the sky.' His
  favorite song, 'Just the Two of Us,' was the very blueprint of his heart.
  
  But recently, the crystal raindrops have turned to tears, the rainbows
  faded. Your father embarked on a final, grand project within the castle's
  highest spires, and he has not returned. Days have blurred into nights, and
  a quiet, unsettling silence has settled over the once vibrant halls.
  
  Determined, you've snuck into the entrance â€” the Crystal Atrium. You carry
  with you the faint echo of his song and the unwavering belief that together,
  you can make it if you try. Your quest is clear: find your father, bring his
  dream back to life, and restore the sunshine to your Sky Castle.
  "Good things might come to those who wait, but not for those who wait too
  late."
  You must go for all you know.



Welcome to Sky Castle! You are in the Crystal Atrium.

Crystal Atrium
==============
  You stand in the magnificent ***Crystal Atrium***, a soaring hall with walls
  of shimmering, giant glass tears slowly descending. Sunlight filters
  through, creating shifting patterns on the polished floor. To the north, a
  vibrant glow pulses; to the east, you hear the rush of water.
  Exits: North, East

Rainbow Gallery
===============
  This circular ***Rainbow Gallery*** is adorned with numerous stained-glass
  panels, but the light is diffuse and muted, lacking the vibrant spectrum
  you'd expect. A path leads south, back to the atrium.
  
  You see: tuning fork
  Exits: South
You take the tuning fork.

Wasted Waterworks
=================
  A vast, damp chamber, the ***Wasted Waterworks***, where strong currents of
  water gush from high pipes, only to disappear uselessly into drains below.
  No plant life can thrive here; the ground is barren and slick. West leads
  back to the atrium.
